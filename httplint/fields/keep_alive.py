The `Keep-Alive` header is completely optional; it is defined primarily because the `keep-alive`
connection token implies that such a header exists, not because anyone actually uses it.

Some implementations (e.g., [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)) do generate a `Keep-Alive` header
to convey how many requests they're willing to serve on a single connection, what the connection
timeout is and other information. However, this isn't usually used by clients.

It's safe to remove this header if you wish to save a few bytes in the response."""
